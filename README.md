# linux_set_up
This repository contains the files I use to configure another linux computer.

Every time I set up another computer on Ubuntu for instance, I run the script_instalation_software.sh file to install some softwares so I and you don't hve to do it by hand.

You have to stay close to your terminal during the instalation to allow the instalations with your password and accept (Y) the softwares.

The file 'script_instalation_software.sh' installs the following software on Ubuntu-like distribution.
Some other softwares require manual instalation for now. 

I work little by little on my linux journey to achieve to write the perfect set-up script which installs all my favorite softwares with the less interaction from me.
